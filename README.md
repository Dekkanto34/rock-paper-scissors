# rock-paper-scissors
A really simple game of rock paper and scissors created in Python. 
Where you input your decision, you need to write your decision (rock, paper, scissors) with lowercase letters, otherwise the game won't work anyway.
In the console, the score of Y is yours and the score of C is computers.
The moment one of the scores achieve the number 3, the game will end. 
You know, it's the first game I upload to GitHub so it's not intermediate at all. 
Thank you for reading!
